%   P = ComputeTransitionProbabilities(stateSpace, map) 
%   computes the transition probabilities between all states in the state 
%   space for all control inputs.
%
%   Input arguments:
%
%       stateSpace:
%           A (K x 3)-matrix, where the i-th row represents the i-th
%           element of the state space.
%
%       map:
%           A (M x N)-matrix describing the world. With
%           values: FREE TREE SHOOTER PICK_UP DROP_OFF BASE
%
%   Output arguments:
%
%       P:
%           A (K x K x L)-matrix containing the transition probabilities
%           between all states in the state space for all control inputs.
%           The entry P(i, j, l) represents the transition probability
%           from state i to state j if control input l is applied.
